LostLight Reversal, Structs and Offsets
Hi, everybody

GameEngine: Messiah Engine
used in many games including Knives Out, Badlanders and similar games

Offsets:
Code:
#define adrObjects 0x39C8B98 //48 8D 2D ? ? ? ? 48 2B FD + 0x38
#define adrD3D11Device 0x39B8DA8 //48 8B 0D ? ? ? ? 48 8B D9 48 89 4C 24 ? 45 33 ED 45 8D 65 FF 44 38 A9 ? ? ? ? 0F 84 ? ? ? ? 48 8B 49 30 E8 ? ? ? ? 89 44 24 48 48 8B 83 ? ? ? ? 48 8B 8B ? ? ? ? 48 89 4D A8 
 
#define D3D11Device_CameraInfo 0x80
 
#define ptrObject1 0x38
#define ptrObject2 0x470
Structures:
Code:
class CameraInfo
{
public:
	char pad_0x0000[0x10]; //0x0000
	Vec3 CamPos; //0x0010 
	char pad_0x001C[0x4]; //0x001C
	D3DXMATRIX Proj; //0x0020 
	D3DXMATRIX View; //0x0060 
	D3DXMATRIX ViewProj; //0x00A0 
 
};
 
struct Vector
{
	DWORD_PTR Begin;
	DWORD_PTR Cur;
	DWORD_PTR End;
};
Code:
Code:
			DWORD_PTR D3D11Device = Memory.Read<DWORD_PTR>(Memory.GameBase + adrD3D11Device);
			DWORD_PTR p1 = Memory.Read<DWORD_PTR>(Memory.GameBase + adrObjects);
			if (D3D11Device)
			{
				DWORD_PTR ptrCameraInfo = Memory.Read<DWORD_PTR>(D3D11Device + D3D11Device_CameraInfo);
 
				DWORD_PTR p2 = Memory.Read<DWORD_PTR>(p1 + ptrObject1);
 
				Vector Objects = Memory.Read<Vector>(p2 + ptrObject2);
 
				CameraInfo Info = Memory.Read<CameraInfo>(ptrCameraInfo);
 
				int Count = (Objects.End - Objects.Begin) / sizeof(DWORD_PTR);
				if (Count > 1)
				{
					char Buf[128] = { 0 };
 
					for (int i = 0; i < Count; i++)
					{
						DWORD_PTR CurObject = Memory.Read<DWORD_PTR>(Objects.Begin + i * (sizeof(DWORD_PTR)));
						if (CurObject)
						{
							DWORD_PTR CurEntity = Memory.Read<DWORD_PTR>(CurObject - 0x10);
							if (CurEntity)
							{
								int Type = Memory.Read<int>(CurEntity + 0x118);
 
								if (Type == 1) //remove unnecessary objects for more correct sorting
								{
									D3DXVECTOR3 Pos = Memory.Read<D3DXVECTOR3>(CurEntity + 0x7C);
									if (WorldToScreen(Pos, Screen, Info.ViewProj))
									{
 
										MyRender->Text(Screen.x, Screen.y, DT_CENTER, WHITE, "Object");
 
									}
								}
							}
						}
					}
				}
			}
